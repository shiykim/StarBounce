# StarBounce

## Background
Inspired by [Stardew Valley](https://stardewvalley.net/) and [Hasee Bounce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I1yb_0xWYU),
StarBounce will be a a game that features a villager whose mission is to obtain as many berries as possible to store away
for the winter. StarBounce will be a one player game with two Stardew Valley characters standing opposite each other at
the platform at the top.

At the bottom of the screen will be a seesaw which will be utilized by the characters to 'bounce' from the seesaw back onto
their designated spots on platform. In the middle of the screen, between the seesaw and the platform, will be berries that speed across
the screen horizontally. The objective of the game is to grab as many berries as possible by bouncing the characters from the seesaw back onto
the platform in under a minute. The rules are as such:

1. If you hit anything that is not a berry - trash, you lose points.
2. The game ends when you run out of time.

## Functionality & MVP

With StarBounce users will be able to:
* Toggle sound on/off
* Start and end the game
* Keep track of score

In addition, this project will include:
* An About modal describing the background and rules of the game
* A production README

## Wireframes
The app will consist of a single screen with the game, nav links, and the about modal. The game screen will be the central point
of the app, and will be centered in the middle. Towards the right will be the links to the developer.

## Architecture and Technologies

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

* JavaScript for game logic,
* Canvas with HTML5,

#Implementation Timeline

Day 1: Get the game screen, elements, and characters rendered on canvas 
Day 2: Game logic of 'bouncing'
Day 3: Tracking score and polishing up frontend
