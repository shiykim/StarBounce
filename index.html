        <p>A game of survival.</p>
        <p>
          For thousands of years, forest spirits have been living quietly among us feeding off berries for sustenance.
          <br>
          However, for the past few years, due to the exponential rise of forest pollution, forest spirits have been wildly unprepared for the winter.
          <br>
          Help the small yet resilient race survive this winter by collecting only fruits - not trash.

        You were not able to get enough berries to sustain the fruit spirits.
        <br>
        Look at how disappointed they are...

        Well will you look at that! You just single handedly saved all the forest spirits.

        Tonight the forest spirits dance in your honor!
